Script is designed to initially boot up, read directory of faces to train the network on, and then runs a scan of to see if it detects any of them. The program expects all the faces in a "face/your name.jpg" format. You will need to update the email user and password to your own to have it email you if it detects someone. As I used this a project to learn python, facial_recognition and opencv, i'm open to suggestions and improvements.

Note: This script rotates the input image as my webcam is rotated by default
